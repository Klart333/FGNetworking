**I'm going joker mode**

I implemented a scoreboard to track how many hits each player has. 

Mostly worked with the bullets, mines and of course the leaderboard ui I made (very beautiful). Made the bullets into NetworkObjects so I know which player shot and incremented a network variable, that's pretty much it. 
Also there were some bugs or things not working correctly that I fixed, so I assume I downloaded a older version. Hopefully that's not an issue. 

Thanks for your time!
