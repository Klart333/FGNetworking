Overall score: 5 + Joker points (which I hope is enough to pass)

13. Live scoreboard
- Mostly worked with the bullets (SingleBullet), mines (StandardMine) and of course the leaderboard ui I made (UILeaderboard & UIPlayerScore). Made the bullets into NetworkObjects so I know which player shot and incremented a network variable on the correct player, that's pretty much it. 

Also there were some bugs or things not working correctly that I fixed, so I assume I downloaded a older version. Hopefully that's not an issue. 

Thanks for your time!
